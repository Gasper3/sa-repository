This project contains simple base repository class for your models.  
All you need to do is:
1. Install this package `python -m pip install sa-repository`
2. Use it in your project
    ```python
    from sa_repository import BaseRepository
    from models import YourSAModel
    
    class SomeModelRepository(BaseRepository[YourSAModel]):
        pass
    ```

Base class contains some general methods to simplify your work with sqlalchemy models e.x

```
